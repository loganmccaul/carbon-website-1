# gatsby-theme-carbon-editor
The Gatsby Theme Carbon Editor on codesandbox makes it easier to write documentation
files for gatsby-theme-carbon without having to set up or use a development environment.

## Why?
Not everyone that writes docs for site that use the gatsby-theme-carbon editor are technical.
This causes a huge barrier for contributions to docs site and bottlenecks developers. The
gatsby-theme-carbon also have long build times when a user is looking to edit a single file.

## How to use?
1. Edit this file (index.mdx) with your own content. This could mean creating your
own docs from scratch, or pasting in existing docs and editing them.

1a. All components available on this site (https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh/getting-started/)
are available for usage here. For example a Resource Card

<Row className="resource-card-group">
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="Carbon Design System"
      href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com"
    >
      ![Github icon](/images/github-icon.png)
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="Carbon Design System"
      href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com"
    >
      ![Github icon](/images/github-icon.png)
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

1b. Add images to the image folder as needed
